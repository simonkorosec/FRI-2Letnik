Adaptive Capital, Information Depreciation and Schumpeterian Growth
This paper develops a search-theoretic approach to optimal growth where agents anticipate continuing technology advance. When agents require an adaptive search investment to `match with' any new technology, but when this learning is depreciated at the inception of the next, we show that an economy will sustain either an equilibrium with frequent advances, coupled with inefficient matching, or one with exactly the opposite characteristics. The cyclical implication is that the immediate effect of technology adoption is a downturn, not a boom. The model offers a broader representation of Schumpeterian creative destruction, while augmenting the human capital foundations of endogenous growth theory.

Wehrwirtschaft: Economics of the Military State
War preparation and warfare are the simple and well defined objectives of economic planning in the military state. This type of economic organization has been called forth by the doctrine of total war. Besides the traditional use of the military proper, total war embraces two new weapons: psychological and economic warfare. In the economics of the military state there is no distinct line of demarcation which separates war from peace. War is no longer regarded as a passing stage of abnormality to be replaced in short by normal conditions of peace; and war economics is no longer a special branch of public finance but penetrates the whole of economic science. In the economics of the military state, there is no unused capacity, industrial or other-wise, since all resources are placed in the service of war preparation and war. The profit motive is retained, but is subject to important modifications. Private initiative, inasmuch as it is recognized and allowed to emerge, is vested with the function of serving the economics of the military state. Depletion of the stock of accumulated wealth, as a source of current consumption, is coordinated with current production, the other source. The traditional concept of normalcy with its excess of national income produced over national income consumed is abandoned.

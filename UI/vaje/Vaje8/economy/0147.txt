Minimum Requirements and Regional Economics, 1980
This paper is an update of the use of empirical estimates made in 1974 using the minimum requirements technique to approximate the percentage of the labor force which would be expected to be employed in each sector of a region's economy depending on its population. This new analysis uses 1980 census figures and discusses current views to using these estimates for approximating the regional trade or income multiplier.

Search and Consumer Theory
A consumer faces list prices for commodities, but can buy one at a discount. Discounts vary randomly between sellers. The number of quotations sought depends on list prices, search costs and wealth. This function is homogeneous of degree zero, and, provided some sufficient conditions are satisfied, is; increasing in wealth; decreasing in search cost; independent of the list price of the discounted commodity if indirect utility is multiplicatively separable; increasing in the list price if the commodity is a necessity; increasing in the list price of substitutes. Slutsky's equation is generalized to include search.

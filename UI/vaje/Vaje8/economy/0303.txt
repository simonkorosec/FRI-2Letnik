Using Stock Price Information to Regulate Firms
This paper examines the role of the information contained in stock prices in the regulation of privatized firms. Stock prices contain noisy but unbiased information about firm's future prospects that regulators can use to decide on some regulatory policies. The main argument developed is that the observation of stock price movements reduces the incentives of regulators to develop their own monitoring technologies and can allow them to commit to relatively light-handed regulations. This protects firm's investments in cost reduction activities and can increase ex ante welfare.

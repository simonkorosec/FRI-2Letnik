The Supply of Skilled Labour and Skill-Biased Technological Progress
This paper presents a model in which the adoption of skill-biased or `unskilled-biased' technologies is endogenous. In this model of endogenous technology choice, an increase in the supply of skilled labour leads to a temporary fall in the skill premium, followed by an expanding gap between the wages of skilled and unskilled workers as technologies adjust towards the more skill-intensive mix appropriate for the greater skill of the workforce. The adjustment in the technology mix results in slower output growth along the transition path.

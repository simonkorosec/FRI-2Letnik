Price Advertising and the Deterioration of Product Quality
Arguments in favour of self-enforced bans on advertising by professionals often rely on the stylized fact that advertising can communicate information about price but not about quality. This being the case, it is argued that allowing professionals to advertise runs the risk that firms will compete vigorously over price at the expense of the quality of their product. This paper shows that even if price can communicate no information directly about quality, it can do so indirectly because price will be a signal of quality. Because of this, allowing advertising is shown to improve consumer welfare.

Are Business Startups Debt-Rationed?
Using a large random sample of UK startups and a rich data set, the paper demonstrates that human capital is the `true' determinant of survival and that the correlation between financial capital and survival is spurious. Provision of finance is demand-driven, with banks supplying funds elastically and business requests governing takeup. Firms self-select for funds on the basis of the human capital endowments of the proprietors with `better' business more likely to borrow. A reason why others have seemingly identified startup debt-gaps may be the failure to test a sufficiently rich empirical model.

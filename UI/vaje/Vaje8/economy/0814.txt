Economics of Saving
I. Spending is the exchange of money for other goods. Saving is accumulation of goods. Transfer of the power to purchase. Hoarding a small, though important, species of saving. Savings not necessarily in the form of capital goods. Relations to thrift. Forms of spending and saving in parallel columns. Lags often involved. The merchant's interest in the return of consumers. Aggregate spending hardly a matter of choice. II. Priority of the obligation to save for a reserve. The accumulation of durable consumption goods, public as well as private, next in rank. Not the business of the rich alone to save. Corporate savings. Overspending more to blame for business depression than oversaving. III. The problem of adjusting the availability of income to the course of needs. Poor economy of the separation of ownership and use of durable goods and general inadequacy of their supply and quality; hence need of saving here. Instalment buying not in general a means of better adjustment; also very costly. IV. Reciprocity of causation in relation to business depression. General expenditure cannot be increased at will. Maladjustment may spread. Greater regularity of labor income might well be secured at the expense of greater irregularity of income from property as the buffer. Less speculative and other varying use of credit would help. More and more evenly distributed saving fundamental. V. No reason why the economist should debar himself from ethical considerations. Thrift a virtue and obviously economical. Economy of saving by the less well-to-do. Mixed motives.

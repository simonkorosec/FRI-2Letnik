Mr Meade's Relation, Kahn's Multiplier and the Chronology of the General Theory
Don Patinkin (1993) and James Meade (1993) explore the relationship among Kahn's multiplier, `Mr Meade's Relation', and Keynes's theory of effective demand, but do not quote Mr Meade's Relation as it appeared in Kahn (1931). This note shows that the 1931 version of Mr Meade's Relation did not include a personal saving propensity. Instead it included other leakages not in the 1993 version. Attention is drawn to derivation of a finite multiplier using the marginal propensity to save by Meade (1933) and by Ralph Hawtrey.

Estimating Multiple-Discrete Choice Models: An Application to Computerization Returns
Buyers in many markets face multiple-discrete choices: they can purchase multiple-units as well as multiple-brands at the same time. This paper presents a multiple-discrete choice model for the analysis of differentiated products demand. Users maximize profits by choosing the number of units of each brand they purchase. I estimate the model using micro-level data on the demand for personal computers. I use the estimated demand structure to assess the welfare gains from computerization and technological innovation in peripherals. The estimated return on investment in personal computers is 92%. Moreover, a 10% increase in the performance-to-price ratio of microprocessors leads to a 2.2% gain in the estimated user surplus.

The Economics of Accountancy
This book is neither a manual for the bookkeeper, nor a purely theoretical work on accountancy. It is best described as an exposition of accountancy theory in harmony with sound economic theory. The theme centers on income, which the author regards as the all-important concept in both economics and accountancy. The problem of the accountant is to value the inflows and outflows of payments incident to business enterprises. Accountants take cognizance of the costs of durable instruments chiefly or solely as a means of evaluating the future services which these instruments may render. When the capacity of a capital good to render further services melts away, its value melts away no matter what its original cost. Accounting should be made, not solely for the benefit of the management, but for the benefit of individual shareholders and of the public who are potential investors in the corporation and purchasers of the services it renders. The book points the way to a sounder science of economics and a better theory and practice of accountancy.

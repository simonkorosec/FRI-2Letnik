A Long Run Structural Macroeconometric Model of the UK
A new modelling strategy that provides a practical approach to incorporating long-run structural relationships, suggested by economic theory, in an otherwise unrestricted VAR model is applied to construct a small quarterly macroeconometric model of the UK, estimated over 1965q1-1999q4 in nine variables: domestic and foreign outputs, prices and interest rates, oil prices, the nominal effective exchange rate, and real money balances. The aim is to develop a model with a transparent and theoretically coherent foundation. Tests of restrictions on the long-run relations of the model are presented. The dynamic properties of the model are discussed and monetary policy shocks identified.

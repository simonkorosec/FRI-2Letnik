Distribution-Free Statistical Inference with Lorenz Curves and Income Shares
The paper considers the problem of statistical inference with estimated Lorenz curves and income shares. The full variance-covariance structure of the (asymptotic) normal distribution of a vector of Lorenz curve ordinates is derived and shown to depend only on conditional first and second moments that can be estimated consistently without prior specification of the population density underlying the sample data. Lorenz curves and income shares can thus be used as tools for statistical inference instead of simply as descriptive statistics.

Are Rising Earnings Profiles a Forced-Saving Mechanism?
This paper tests the hypothesis that rising earnings profiles are a mechanism by which individuals engage in forced saving. It does this by examining the cross-sectional relationship between overwithholding on income tax payments--behaviour that is consistent with a preference for forced saving--and the slopes of age-earnings profiles. The forced-saving hypothesis receives support from earnings regression estimates. Individuals who receive tax refunds are on earnings profiles that are significantly steeper and have significantly lower intercepts.

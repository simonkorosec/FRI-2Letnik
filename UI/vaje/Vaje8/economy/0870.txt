Demand for Local Public Spending: Evidence from the British Social Attitudes Survey
The British Social Attitudes Survey (BSAS) is a UK-wide survey that provides a rich source of information on individuals attitudes to a variety of topics including locally provided service. In this paper we seek to model answers to questions on attitudes to local authority spending which invite the expression of a private demand for local public spending. A convincing picture has emerged of locally provided public goods as imperfectly congested public goods, with a price elastic and probably income inelastic demand. The view that central government grants may induce voter confusion over tax prices of public services also finds support.

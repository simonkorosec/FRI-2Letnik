An Appraisal of Institutional Economics
Paper presented at Round Table Conference, December 29, 1931, at forty-fourth annual meeting of the American Economic Association, Washington, D.C. Veblen's attempt to make of economics an evolutionary science has been little developed by other economists. The differentiating characteristics of an institutional economics are hard to find; but some economists have oriented their thinking by a postulated institutional prescription of human conduct in an evolving society, in association with an attack upon the ideology of systematic economic theory. The central concern of this group for economic theory has, however, been in making it relevant to problems of social control. Descriptive studies have constituted the principal recent additions to economic knowledge. Few if any of these can be regarded as integral parts of a differentiated institutional economics. Nor can one find peculiarly institutional contributions to the solution of problems of economic control. The supposed existence of a distinguishable body of economic knowledge or theory properly to be called institutional is an intellectual fiction.

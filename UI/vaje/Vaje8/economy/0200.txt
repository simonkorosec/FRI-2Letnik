Inventories in the Open Economy Macro Model: A Disequilibrium Analysis
This study examines a disequilibrium model of a small open economy with explicit links between periods due to inventory accumulation, as well as the more conventional channels through current account imbalances and the government budget constraint. The key features of the model are that agents have perfect foresight with neutral public debt and that inventories adjust to smooth production intertemporarily. The paper explores the extent to which fiscal policy can be used selectively for coping with an export slump without running into a balance of payments constraint.

The Economics of Export-Performance Requirements
This paper analyzes the resource-allocation and welfare effects of export performance requirements imposed on foreign investors. It argues that a satisfactory analysis must consider the presence of tariff distortions and oligopolistic behavior in host-country markets. These create a second-best environment in which an evaluation of the welfare effects of such requirements is no longer straightforward. It is concluded that export requirements can improve home welfare by reducing payments to foreign capital, reducing the output of commodities which are being overproduced, and shifting profits toward domestically owned firms.
